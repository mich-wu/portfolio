Michelle Wu - Portfolio
</h1>

Hi there! This is a portfolio showcasing my journey and experiences as a web developer. 

 **Built using the following tech:**

    React, DatoCMS, GraphQL, Gatsby, and SCSS

I want to thank the following people:
Anton Purver, Nathan Newell, Callum Radford, Tim Williams, Hannah Sandilands, Kate Parr, and Kale Joines. My beloved dev team at HC are who made me the developer I am today ðŸ’“ 

This is an on-going work in progress - I want to convert it to typescript and also play around with GSAP ðŸ˜Š
